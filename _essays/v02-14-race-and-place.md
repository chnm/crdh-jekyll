  In the 1930s, the New Deal provided employment for cultural workers through organizations like the Federal Writers' Project (FWP). The federal government sent writers across the country to collect life histories, an emerging genre at the intersection of oral history, ethnography, and literature. Among the most prominent and debated are the Ex-Slave Narratives, a collection of over 2,400 life histories with former enslaved peoples. Rather than focusing on the Ex-Slave Narratives as a source for understanding the antebellum era or American south during Reconstruction, this article explores how the writing style of the narratives shaped the construction of race and southern identity in the late 1930s.
  
  Using text analysis, I show how dialect was not only racialized but also connected to a particular (cultural) geography—the American South. I build off of Catherine Stewart's argument that Ex-Slave Narratives dialect was racialized and often worked to deny interviewees rights to full citizenship by using this powerful representational, rhetorical strategy to "other" formerly enslaved people and therefore deny their full selfhood in the interviews. At the same time, the FWP's Southern Life Histories Project—which focused on life histories with laborers in the lowest economic strata residing in the South—marked dialect as a regional feature. Dialect, therefore, also signified that the person speaking was rural, uneducated, and Southern. This came at a time when Southern life was under a microscope; the national debate centered around whether the South was the reason the nation struggled to end the Great Depression and progress. Dialect effectively marked a person as poor, black, and southern, leaving those interviewed in the Ex-Slave Narratives representationally on the margins of US society.

From 1936 to 1938, interviewers sat on porches, in living rooms, and at
kitchen tables asking black citizens about their lives under chattel
slavery and after emancipation. These writers were employees of the
federal government's Work Progress Administration's Federal Writers'
Project (FWP), a New Deal organization designed to support cultural
workers through employment. Who and how people were represented in the
FWP's writings shaped inclusion, citizenship, and national
identity.[^1] The stakes were high as cultural and political struggles
ensued over the identity and future of a nation in the throes of a Great
Depression, while simultaneously debating the meaning and memory of the
antebellum era during the 75th anniversary of the Civil War.[^2]

Historian Jerrold Hirsch argues that the FWP's goal was to celebrate
American pluralism in order to depict a nation culturally rich because
of its diversity and heterogeneity.[^3] The project exemplar was the
State Guide Series---a collection of books focused on the history,
culture, and people of each state---designed to be a "portrait of
America". Lesser known are a plethora of projects concerned with
documenting the lives of citizens in their words through narrative,
often called life histories. The rationale for these projects differed
from those of the Guide Series. Of primary concern was cultural and
historical knowledge that was understood as disappearing due to
assimilation into modernity, such as folk culture including folklore and
ballads, or because those who remembered historical events were passing,
such as the stories and experiences of the generation that had lived
during chattel slavery and emancipation. FWP administrators, such as
national folklore editor John Lomax, were not concerned with pluralism,
but rather with saving folkways and memories that were perceived to be
vanishing.[^4]

Among the most prominent and debated life histories are the Ex-Slave
Narratives.[^5] FWP interviewers---most of whom were white and over half
women---documented the narratives of over 2,400 formerly enslaved
people.[^6] Using a script of questions as their guide, interviewers
asked about life during chattel slavery. Throughout the tenure of the
project, they added questions about life following emancipation and
folklore.[^7] The interviews were transcribed from memory and field
notes and then revised by state and national editors. Where the
interview was conducted, which questions were emphasized, and how
answers were documented shaped the narratives.

The conditions that created the Ex-Slave Narratives has led to ongoing
scholarly debates about exactly what historians can learn.[^8] Benjamin
Botkin, FWP national folklore editor from 1938-1939, released *Lay My
Burden Down* in 1945 to explain the importance of the interviews, yet
interest in the book was minimal. The rise of the new social history
alongside the black liberation struggle ignited interest in reassessing
the history of slavery. Historians rediscovered the Ex-Slave Narratives
in the 1970s. Debates ensued about the narrative's authenticity.
Scholars have argued that the narratives are empirical evidence of black
life from the mid-1800s to the 1930s. Others have called for their
complete dismissal as unreliable and a white-washing of the black
experience.[^9] In other words, a fiction constructed by white writers
and editors invested in diminishing the violence of chattel slavery and
improvements post-emancipation in order to perpetuate Lost Cause
narratives and question black citizens fitness for citizenship.[^10]
More recent scholarship---informed by work on oral history and the
ethnographic encounter as a site of negotiation shaped by each person's
positioning---complicates the facile categorization of the narratives
as either truth or fiction.[^11]

Catherine Stewart's influential 2016 book *Long Past Slavery*
exemplifies the shift. She focuses on how social knowledge produced at
the intersection of oral history and ethnography can illuminate
historical knowledge about the 1930s. The Ex-Slave Narratives, she
argues, became a site to negotiate black people's right to full
citizenship and to be a part of the nation's identity. Writers used
memories of slavery and life post-emancipation as well as the ways they
transcribed the interviews as arguments for and against African
Americans' fitness to be full citizens. The subjectivity of the
interviewer, the questions posed, responses from interviewees, and the
ways the stories were written shaped the narratives, which became a
contested space to assert or de-legitimize black selfhood and therefore
rights to full incorporation into the nation.[^12]

The narratives therefore risked reifying the antebellum social order, a
segregated underclass managed and contained by middle- and upper-class
whites. If the promises of emancipation were control over one's life,
the narratives were anything but in their control. Such conditions do
not mean that those interviewing weren't earnest in their intentions to
listen, or that interviewees didn't make room or assert agency through
practices such as signifying, as Stewart argues.[^13] However, like
emancipation, full control over their own lives was as partial as their
ability to speak for themselves in these interviews.

Among the most contentious issues is the use of dialect. Interviewers
were instructed to capture the words of the interviewee. As FWP's
Associate Director George Cronyn wrote, "While it is desirable to give
a running story of the life of each subject, the color and human
interest will be greatly enhanced if it is told largely in the words of
the person interviewed. The peculiar idiom is often more expressive than
a literary account."[^14] Yet, exactly how to represent local and
regional variations of language in writing was a thorny project.

In response, John Lomax, Folklore Editor from 1936 to 1937, developed a
"negro dialect" to represent black vernacular speech patterns.[^15] He
set out to standardize how local variations would be written. For
example, dialect words such as "de" or "dat" were spelled without an
"h" because the letter was considered unnecessary, and words like
"poe" should not be used for "po' (poor)." [^16] As a result, FWP
writers flattened regional variations into a single speech style
intended to represent all black oral traditions across the U.S.[^17]

{% figure caption: "Figure 1. The graph plots the top words indicative of dialect in the
Ex-Slave Narratives." %}
![Bar graph showing the top fifty words indicative of dialect in Ex-Slave Narratives. The top five words are "wuz", "dere", "jes", "pappy", and "missus."]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/tilton/figure1.png)
{% endfigure %}

Text analysis reveals which words were most indicative of dialect. In
order to identify dialect terms, the Ex-Slave Narratives were converted
to plain text files and words not found in a standard english word list
were isolated. The top 120 remaining words were then manually labeled
and filtered to detect 92 dialect terms. Frequencies of the most common
dialect terms are shown in Figure 1. Words such as "wuz" (in lieu of
"was") and "dere" (in lieu of "there") were the most used.

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. Dialect frequency (occurrences per 1000 words) by race of
interviewer, with 95% confidence intervals. White interviewers were
significantly more likely to use dialect in the life histories that they
created." %}
![Graph showing the dialect frequency for a black interviewer ranged from approximately two and a half to five occurrences per one thousand words, while the dialect frequency for a white interviewer ranged from approximately eleven to twelve and a half per one thousand words.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/tilton/figure2.png){% endfigure %}

Next, the extent of dialect in the collection was compared to the race
of the interviewer (Figure 2). After identifying the top 100 words
indicative of dialect, they were queried across the corpus of 2,400
interviews from the Library of Congress. The percentage of dialect in
each life history was calculated. Each life history was then categorized
by the race of the interviewer. White interviewers were significantly
more likely to use dialect. Mary Hicks of North Carolina, Watt McKinney
of Arkansas, and Annie Ruth Davis of South Carolina used the most
dialect words. The findings extend Stewart's argument---that dialect
was used more by white interviewers from a subset of Florida and Georgia
---to the entire collection.[^18]

{% figure caption: "Figure 3. Topic model (LDA) of Ex-Slave Narratives. Posterior weights
for top ten words in each topic are shown. The prevalence of dialect
terms in the topics reveals the significance of dialect as a rhetorical
strategy in the interviews." %}
![Graph of topic model with sixteen topics. The top ten words in topics seven and eleven are almost all dialect words.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/tilton/figure3.png)
{% endfigure %}

Topic modeling, which identifies themes and discourses in the
collection, also confirmed that dialect was prominent among white
interviewees. Along with returning topics about family life and farming
during slavery, the topic model returned clusters of words comprised
almost entirely of dialect words such as Topic 11 (Figure 3). Topic
models therefore also reveal rhetorical strategies. The topics indicate
that using "negro dialect" was not only a pattern but a strategy for
constructing racialized subjectivities.[^19]

Importantly, certain topics were more likely to be used by white
interviewers than black interviewers and vice versa (Figure 4). For
example, Topic 7 is mostly dialect words and far more prominent in
interviews conducted by white writers. On the other hand, Topic 12,
which discusses interviewees relationship to their "family" and
"master", is devoid of dialect words, and more prominent in interviews
led by black interviewers.

{% figure caption: "Figure 4. Number of documents in each topic categorized by race of
interviewer. Topics with a significant number of dialect words are much
more likely to be found in white interviewers' life histories as
compared to black interviewers' life histories." %}
![Bar graph showing number of documents, by topic and race of interviewer. Black interviewers are represented by red bars, while white interviewers are represented by blue bars.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/tilton/figure4.png)
{% endfigure %}

The call for a "negro dialect" served two purposes, Stewart argues.
First, dialect signaled authenticity. White FWP workers argued that the
interviews truly represented black voices since the style of speech
aligned with common stereotypes of black vernacular speech patterns.
Second, the FWP planned to publish the narratives for a primarily white
audience. Their market hopes were not unfounded since slave narratives
circulated within the abolitionist press for almost a century and the
1930s literary markets produced a significant interest in Southern
life.[^20] Too much variation in dialect would make them too difficult
to read. Cronyn captured this duality in his instructions to state
directors. He wrote, "This does not mean that the interviews should be
entirely in 'straight English'---simply, that we want to be more
readable to those uninitiated in the broadest Negro speech".[^21]

Local or regional variations in speech patterns were dismissed in the
service of a homogenous, singular black dialect constructed by John
Lomax and his white colleagues for white audiences. Race, therefore,
became a linguistic feature used primarily by white interviewers argues
Stewart.[^22] Because formerly enslaved peoples were represented as
speaking in the same racialized dialect, the narratives served as a form
of "othering." The use of dialect in Ex-Slave Narratives
simultaneously signaled authenticity to white audiences as argued by
Lomax while marginalizing their voices by signifying their position as
second-class citizens as argued by Sterling Brown and black
writers.[^23]

However, dialect signaled not just race but a particular regional
identity and place---being a "Southerner" residing in the southeast
states of the contingent United States---that also risked subjugating
the interviewees' voices. Stereotypes abounded of the region as
anti-modern, degenerate, and uneducated through works like Erskine
Caldwell's *Tobacco Road*. Intellectuals such as Rupert Vance and Howard
Odum and government officials such as President Franklin Roosevelt alike
were discussing how to handle the "Southern Problem."[^24] The South's
economic woes, seen as exceptional and pervasive even by contemporary
standards, combined with Jim Crow and spectacular racial violence, left
questions about the region's fitness for full inclusion and
citizenship.[^25] Dialect became more broadly a marker that was one
uneducated, rural, and southern.

Dialect became linked with southerness through the Southern Life
Histories Project, which also used the "negro dialect" that flattened
regional variations in black vernacular. FWP writers, almost all white,
traveled across the South interviewing mostly white southerners. The
project focused on southern workers at the lowest economic strata such
as tenant farmers and mill workers. The aim, according to William T.
Couch who led the effort, was to capture the conditions of the south in
the words of the people. If Americans heard their voices, they would
understand the social and economic challenges of the region and be more
likely to see the larger causes of inequality, rather than blaming the
conditions to individual moral failing, and support New Deal policies
that aided the region. The FWP was at the center of defining Southern
identity at a time when the meaning of the South was of great national
interest.

{% figure caption: "Figure 5. Dialect word frequency in the Southern Life Histories Project.
Dialect words were also common in the Southern Life Histories Project, a
Federal Writers' Project life histories project that occurred at the
same time as the Ex-Slave Narratives project." %}
![Bar graph showing the top fifty words indicative of dialect in the Southern Life Histories Project. The top five words are "wuz", "workin", "jes", "dere", and "mornin."]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/tilton/figure5.png)
{% endfigure %}

{% figure caption: "Figure 6. Dialect frequency (occurrences per 1000 words) by race of
interviewee, with 95% confidence intervals. Dialect words were used more
frequently in interviews with black Americans." %}
![Graph showing the dialect frequency for a black interviewee ranged from approximately five and a half to seven and a half occurrences per one thousand words, while the dialect frequency for a white interviewee ranged from approximately two and a half to thee per one thousand words.]({{site.url}}/assets/img/v02/tilton/figure6.png)
{% endfigure %}

Text analysis reveals that dialect was also prevalent in the Southern
Life Histories Project. Like the Ex-Slave Narratives, words like "wuz"
and "dere" were among the most prominent (Figure 5). However, dialect
was not equally applied. It was used significantly more often for black
interviews (Figure 6). Dialect then becomes a racial as well as southern
marker and had the effect of positioning interviewees in the bottom
socioeconomic and education strata of Southern society. What we then see
is that that the Ex-Slave Narratives weren't just about understanding
slavery. They were a part of isolating slavery to a southern problem.
Dialect became a rhetorical performance working powerfully at the
intersection of race, class, and geography, producing a double
subjugation that othered the formerly enslaved people represented in the
Ex-Slave Narratives.

Explaining the collection in 1941, Botkin wrote, "These life histories,
taken down as far as possible in the narrator's words, constitute an
invaluable body of unconscious evidence or indirect source material,
which scholars and writers dealing with the South, especially, social
psychologists and cultural anthropologists, cannot afford to reckon
without."[^26] The FWP then was at the center of defining Southern
identity, not only at a time when the meaning of the South was of great
national interest, but for future generations.

[^5]: The term “Ex-Slave” is problematic because it reduces the personhood of those in chattel slavery. Terms such as “enslaved people” have become prominent in order to assert that a person’s selfhood cannot be reduced to a “slave”.  I have chosen to use the term “Ex-Slave Narratives”, which this set of writing has become known as, to signal a particular scholarly conversation and historiography that this paper engages with.  

[^6]: The ex-slave collection includes documents from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.  A small portion (approximately ten percent) of the collection were collected in states outside of the South. It is known that Virginia has a significant number of interviews but is not well represented because their materials were held by the state office. They are now at the Library of Virginia.
