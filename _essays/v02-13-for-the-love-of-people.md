abstract: |
   With its all-female leadership and its balance of black nationalism, experimental art, and the politics of respectability, the Berkeley cultural center Rainbow Sign suggests some of the hidden complexities of the Black Arts Movement as it translated itself into the 1970s. Reflecting on their digital curation of the Rainbow Sign archive, the authors suggest that, while a computation-driven strain of digital history has broken much new methodological ground, another strain of digital history-oriented to a larger public and interested in dramatizing the complexities of primary sources through the affordances of digital media-can also yield fresh arguments through the pressure it puts on primary sources to speak to one another. We suggest that the work of digital curation is especially suited for dramatizing the often invisible curatorial work performed by black women such as Mary Ann Pollar, the founder of Rainbow Sign.

### 1. Hidden Figures: Mary Ann Pollar and the Black Female Leadership of Rainbow Sign

On the weekend of August 21, 1971, on a street that long had served as a dividing line between white and black Berkeley, a formerly dilapidated mortuary was reborn as [Rainbow Sign](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/projects/rainbow-sign), a black cultural center that, tellingly perhaps, has largely disappeared from histories of the Black Arts Movement.[^1]

{% endfigure %}

Brainstormed into existence by music promoter Mary Ann Pollar, with help from a group of black female professionals, Rainbow Sign sought simultaneously to "showcase the best there is of the Black experience" and to "set a Black table at which everyone is welcome to eat."[^2] As art gallery, performance venue, lecture hall, rentable community meeting space, soul food restaurant and private membership club, Rainbow Sign projected a broad ethic of intercultural care---one which made the richness of black culture available for all committed to the struggle without compromising the centrality of the black community and its needs.

In its five-plus years of existence, Rainbow Sign often featured luminaries such as [Maya Angelou](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/see-maya-angelou-rs/),
[Elizabeth Catlett](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/depicting-black-struggle/),[Odetta](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/odessa-liberian-tribal-dance-company/?cat=437&subcat=1), [Nina Simone](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/nina-simone-contact-sheet/?cat=437&subcat=1), and [James Baldwin](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/james-baldwin-contact-sheet/); equally, it nurtured emerging artists such Terry McMillan, Ntozake Shange, and [Betye Saar](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/liberation-aunt-jemima/) (whose *Liberation of Aunt Jemima*---an artwork that Angela Davis has named as the origin point of the modern black women's movement---was created for an exhibition there).[^3] All the while, it hosted a wide range of political figures---from African dignitaries to African-American leaders such as presidential candidate [Shirley Chisholm](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/shirley-chisholm-campaign-trail/?cat=437&subcat=4); [Warren Widener](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/mayors-proclamation-nina-simone-day/), Berkeley's first black mayor; and Black Panther Huey Newton.[^4] The openness of Rainbow Sign's programming meant that, at different moments, it took on different coloration. At times it looked like a social club for the emerging black middle class of the East Bay, as it sought to realize the 1970s form of the black clubwomen's motto of "lifting as we climb."[^5] At others, it served as a hospitable staging ground for the more transformative visions articulated by radical artists like Jayne Cortez, Bob Kaufman, Catlett, and Simone.[^6]

Despite the resurgence of historical work on black politics and art in the 1970s Bay Area, Rainbow Sign has yet to receive much critical attention.[^7] Whether because of its location (in Berkeley rather than Oakland), or because of its difficult-to-pin-down politics, or because of its multifaceted blend of politics and culture, it falls outside the scope of pioneering works on East Bay black politics in the 1970s such as Robert Self's *American Babylon* and Donna Murch's *Living for the City*.[^8] Meanwhile, the broader history of the Black Arts Movement has largely been told via figures who fit a particular profile: young, male, and militantly identified with the black working class---figures who speak to and for, as the language of the Black Panther Party would have it, the "brothers on the block."[^9] Yet, as historians such as Brittney Cooper, Ashley Farmer and others have suggested, this period was also deeply enriched by the work of black women, who provided their own understanding of what the project of political and cultural liberation entailed.[^10]

Rainbow Sign opens onto another front of black women's activism in the age of Black Power---a front led by professionally successful black women, of a slightly older generation, who sought at once to elevate black culture, transform American politics, and provide mentorship to younger artists so that, rather than scuffling forever, they might build a career of art-making.[^11] In the Rainbow Sign, older strains of respectability politics were synthesized with an embrace of grassroots Black Nationalist organizing and Afrocentric aesthetics. We might see this fusion in the aesthetic of Rainbow Sign's promotional materials: for the club's opening, guests were "soulfully invited" to the event by an image of a dapper black man in turn-of-the-century coat, tie, and high collar. The club's motto was "for the love of people"---not "for the love of *the* people" (which might contrast "the people" with "the elites," in the manner that the Black Panther Party elevated "the lumpen"), and not "for the love of black people" (which would have underlined the center's orientation toward the black community). With "for the love of people," Rainbow Sign intimated that its founding principle was an all-accepting ethos of care and love.[^12]

{% figure caption: "Figure 2. "Invitation to the Opening of Rainbow Sign*," Aug. 1971. *Courtesy of Odette Pollar*." %}
![Invitation for the opening of Rainbow Sign, featuring the image of a dapper black man in turn-of-the-century coat, tie, and high collar. The invitation reads: "You are soulfully invited to attend the opening of The Rainbow Sign. A Membership Club at 2640 Grove Street, Berkeley, California on August 21 and 22, 1971, from 11am to 7pm."](/assets/img/v02/saul/figure2.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

This ethos led Mary Ann Pollar to embrace the role of curator: Pollar was at once central to everything that transpired at her center and also a hidden structuring presence, orchestrating a community without seeming to wield the conductor's baton. This was hidden work, performed by a now-hidden figure. Yet it's also true that Pollar, with impressive self-awareness, gave an account of what she
imagined that such curation could achieve. In Rainbow Sign's "Background
and Philosophy," she meditated on how the design of the center could
lead the black community to become "involved and enriched," describing
how its artist showcases would set in motion a virtuous cycle:

> By providing this "showcase" we would fill several needs in this
> community. (1) The need of artists to show their works or talents and,
> most importantly, to do so outside the usual commercial setting...(2) We fill the need of a controlled situation wherein the promising
> artist could interact with the professional on a one to one basis.
> Third, and to us most important, we would have a place where young
> children could come and be influenced by people they regard as
> heroes.[^13]

Pollar envisioned a neat multi-generational model of art in the black community---one that would bind children to their artist-heroes, the
"promising artist" to the established "professional," and all artists to an audience that would come together "outside the usual," and often white- dominated, "commercial setting." Rainbow Sign put that model into practice with aplomb over its five-year run, helping to launch the careers of an impressive number of figures while consolidating the careers of many others.

Recently, literary historian Margo Natalie Crawford has powerfully suggested that the "second wave" of the Black Arts Movement in the 1970s opened up the categories of black art-making in a manner that in our current moment feels particularly prophetic. Anything but hamstrung by a narrow sense of racial identity, BAM artists troubled blackness without worrying about the loss of blackness; celebrated and investigated what it felt like to "be" black as well as "become" black; and experimented with techniques of mixed-media, abstraction, and parody that tie them to contemporary writers ranging from Claudia Rankine and Harryette Mullen to Mat Johnson and Terrance Hayes. The work produced through Rainbow Sign---the artworks hung on its walls, and the music, dance and drama that unfolded on its stage---resonates strongly with Crawford's characterization of the Black Arts Movement's second wave. It brought together pride and irony, open-ended exploration and pointed critique. Meanwhile the social history of Rainbow Sign suggests the organizational energy and the curatorial spirit of care that rested at the foundation of this second wave, at least in the Bay Area and perhaps elsewhere. As more cultural historians come to appreciate the "long history of the Black Arts movement," it is crucial that we acknowledge the women who birthed new organizational forms and helped give the Black Arts Movement its new surge of life in the 1970s.[^14]

### II. Beyond Figures: Digital Curation and the Promise of Non-Computational Methods within Digital History

If we have gauged our own efforts appropriately, the first section of this essay should be legible *as* history, in that it presents an argument about Rainbow Sign using the methods---narrative, citation of evidence, references to the relevant historiography---that are conventional in the profession. Less conventional, however, was the method by which we arrived at this argument: a blend of old-fashioned archival digging and of curation techniques tied to the affordances of digital media. If, as Cameron Blevins has proposed, digital history "has over-promised and under-delivered" in the realm of argument-driven scholarship because of its "love affair with methodology," we would suggest that the problem lies, in part, with how we have tended to define the methodological tools specific to digital history.[^15]

"We are infatuated with the power of digital tools and techniques to do things that humans cannot, such as dynamically mapping thousands of geo-historical data points," Blevins continues. What is lost, we wonder, when digital history is largely defined through data-driven methods of computational analysis, mapping, and visualization? Our experience suggests that digital history would be wise to consider how other methods---less computation-driven but tied to digital media---can lay the foundation for fresh historical arguments. In our case, the method was the act of building a well-annotated, highly structured multimedia exhibition around a set of some fifty-plus primary sources, selected from many more.

In order to reconstruct the cultural work of Rainbow Sign's Mary Ann Pollar, we needed in our case to become digital curators, which in turn meant sticking very close to our primary documents, keying into the spirit of Pollar's enterprise, and modeling her own curatorial ethos anew.[^16]

This digital archive was built through an honors undergraduate seminar in American Studies at UC Berkeley ("The Bay Area in the Seventies"), in which one of us (Scott) was the teacher and another one of us (Tessa) was a student, working with a fellow student (Max Lopez) on Rainbow Sign. The Rainbow Sign project was one of eleven such student-generated (and professor-guided) projects, spanning topics from the ecology movement and the disability rights movement to the desegregation of Berkeley's public schools and the history of a pioneering queer resource center, incubated through two iterations of this small research seminar in 2017 and 2018.

{% figure caption: "Figure 3. Homepage of [The Berkeley Revolution,](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/) featuring (visibly) six of the eleven projects generated by twenty students across two UC Berkeley American Studies undergraduate seminars." %}
![A screenshot of the homepage for The Berkeley Revolution project.](/assets/img/v02/saul/figure3.png)
{% endfigure %}

Methodologically, the course asked students, first, to do the conventional work of a history research seminar: find a fresh set of primary sources and, through secondary reading, ask informed questions of those sources.[^17] Instead of producing the typical undergraduate research essay---a slimmed-down version of a scholarly article---students proceeded to build curated digital exhibitions, working in stages and from the primary sources outward. The site architecture enforced a certain scrupulousness. First came the annotation of primary sources,
with each represented by a well-chosen thumbnail and tag line that
encapsulated its point of interest.[^18] Next came the sorting of the
larger set of primary sources into clusters of usually between three and
nine---clusters which themselves needed to be ordered and also given a
telegraphic but explanatory title. This clustering operation often
proved quite difficult---and forced students to grapple with the fact
that primary documents do not speak to one another until the historian
puts them in dialogue. Last came the crafting of the framing essay,
which built upon the narrative structured by the "clusters." Our
experience confirmed Michael Kramer's insight about the productive
strictures of the digital: rather than use computation to speed up
analysis, the course used its tailored WordPress site to slow down
thinking and to force attention toward the level of granular detail and
to put pressure on the relation between evidence and argument.[^19]

{% endfigure %}

While abiding by the protocols of the historian, we have also sought, in our digital curation of the Rainbow Sign archive, to work in the spirit of Mary Ann Pollar. Just as she advertised Rainbow Sign as a ["unique multi-dimensional club where beautiful people meet, greet and eat,"](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/rainbow-sign-membership-brochure/?cat=437&subcat=0) a center that was "open to all who are sympathetic to our Black orientation, cognizant of our vast diversity, and dedicated to quality achievement," so we tried to create a convivial digital space that would be sharp in its design and unwavering in its hospitality to all. Alongside our presentation of primary documents, we aimed to offer analysis that was straightforward and precise. Our design aimed not to emphasize our own authority as gatekeepers of knowledge but to illuminate the process and even the delight of building a collective history. By bringing the original documents into the spotlight, we strove to equip site visitors to become curator-historians themselves---to meet us in the archive, as it were. Our format hopes, in the spirit of Rainbow Sign, to kindle curiosity, prompt diverse interpretations, and spur conversation rather than conversion.[^20]

It is easy to downplay the analytical work of curation since it is the sort of "care work" that is often considered menial and gendered female. Curation, write the authors of *Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0* (2009), involves "custodial responsibilities with respect to the remains of the past as well as interpretative, meaning-making responsibilities with respect to the present and future."[^21] Clearly they mean to praise curation, not bury it, but the phrase "custodial responsibilities" typically attaches to those pushing brooms, not tapping keyboards. In this context, we find the curatorial labor of Mary Ann Pollar particularly inspiring as a model of egalitarian and necessary cultural work. History easily forgets those who set the stage, invite the artists, welcome the public, and literally keep the lights on, but it is useful to recall that without them there is no stage, no public, and no lights. Digital history could well borrow some of the humility associated with the curator's role, while learning better to draw from its considerable power.

We also wish to thank Suzanne Smith and *CRDH*'s anonymous reviewers,

and expand its scope.

[^1]: The building that Mary Ann Pollar rented to house Rainbow Sign
had a telling history, as did the immediately surrounding area. 2640
Grove Street had been built in 1925 as the "Ivory Chapel" of funeral
director Edward E. Niehaus, likely the son of Edward F. Niehaus, a West
German immigrant, lumber magnate and Berkeley stalwart. The Niehaus
mortuary featured a Spanish Colonial Revival design by architect James
W. Plachek, who also designed important Berkeley civic buildings such as
the city's Central Library and North Branch Public Library.

In the 1940s, when large numbers of African-Americans were drawn to
Berkeley because of jobs in East Bay war industries, Grove Street became
an even sharper boundary separating white and non-white Berkeley, with
blacks made aware through the 1950s, at least, that they were not
welcome to buy real estate above Grove Street.

In an important reversal of the process of segregation, it was at a
storefront office at 2554 Grove Street---less than a block from Rainbow
Sign's soon-to-be location---that the Berkeley Unified School District
drew up its 1968 plan to desegregate the city's elementary schools
through organized busing. (Berkeley remains the only city that
voluntarily drew up and embraced its own busing plan.) Just afterward,
this storefront office hosted educational innovator Herb Kohl, who
devised the paradigmatic "open school" (alternative high school) called Other Ways. Mary Ann Pollar
appreciated that her Grove Street location placed her close to five
local schools, including an elementary school, middle school and high
school: "We want those children to short-cut through Rainbow Sign," she
said. Thus did the boundary between white and black Berkeley become the
creative borderlands where projects of desegregation, especially at the
youth level, were incubated and put into practice. Campus Planning

[^6]: NEED NOTE!!!!

[^7]: While we detail below the lack of attention paid to Rainbow Sign
by historians and literary critics, we are also happy to note that,
since the publication of the "Rainbow Sign" digital project on the
Berkeley Revolution site in the summer of 2017, there has been
snowballing attention to the center. In May of 2018, *LA Times* art
critic Christopher Knight mentioned it as a key context for New
York-based artist Rashid Johnson's acclaimed "Rainbow Sign" exhibition
(Knight, "Rashid Johnson"). In February of 2019, the Oakland Museum of
California opened a re-designed "Black Power" installation that featured
the center, and currently the de Young Museum in San Francisco is
looking to spotlight Rainbow Sign as they customize the exhibition *Soul
of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power* (opening November 2019)
around the arts of the Bay Area. In the realm of politics, US Senator
Kamala Harris drew upon the primary documents in the digital project and
made the Rainbow Sign central to the first chapter of her memoir *The
Truths We Hold*, published in January 2019. Observing that her time
there as a child shaped her sense of cultural and political possibility,
the Berkeley-raised politician noted that Rainbow Sign "was where I
learned that artistic expression, ambition, and intelligence were cool.
It was where I came to understand that there is no better way to feed
someone's brain than by bringing together food, poetry, politics, music,
dance, and art." Harris, *The Truths We Hold,* 16--19.

[^9]: In his groundbreaking *The Black Arts Movement,* literary
historian James Smethurst nicely sketches how the campuses of UC
Berkeley, San Francisco State, and Merritt College became hotbeds of
activism and black cultural production. Yet when he turns his attention
off-campus, Smethurst focuses his narrative on cultural centers such as
San Francisco's Black House, the short-lived and contentious project
that brought together Black Panther scribe Eldridge Cleaver and the
radical playwrights Ed Bullins and Marvin X.

[^11]: Pollar and the ten women who served on Rainbow Sign's board
were from a middle generation---younger than race radicals such as
Ella Baker (b. 1903) and Angelo Herndon (b. 1913) whose perspectives
were centrally shaped by the labor struggles of the Great Depression,
and older than Baby Boomer figures like Huey Newton (b. 1942) and Angela
Davis (b. 1944). A descendant of a line of Baptist preachers, Mary Ann
Pollar herself was born in a Texas border town in 1927, and took a
degree in labor education from Roosevelt College in Chicago in the
late 1940s; through the 1950s and 1960s she worked for the Bay Area
Urban League while establishing herself as music promoter through her
work with acts from Bob Dylan and Odetta to Curtis Mayfield and Simon
and Garfunkel. The Rainbow Sign board was populated by black women who
had broken professional barriers, including TV newscaster Belva Davis,
and East Bay education leaders Mary Jane Johnson and [Electra Price](http://revolution.berkeley.edu/electra-price/?cat=437&subcat=6).

[^12]: This fusion between radical and respectable can also be read
in the aspirational and care-oriented language that its founders used to
evoke its project. Rainbow Sign board member Electra Price described the

[^16]: The larger place of archival curation within digital history is
well-sketched in the white paper which emerged from the 2017 Arguing
with Digital History working group: "Digital History and Argument."

[^17]: The Rainbow Sign project drew upon an archive of six dusty
boxes, stashed in the basement of the Oakland home of Mary Ann Pollar's
daughter Odette---boxes that had never before been opened by her. Time
constraints limited the amount of material we were able to scan for the
project, so we opted to include ephemera with striking visual appeal,
such as the invitations to art exhibits, or items with rich
informational content, such as the brochures.

[^18]: Once readers navigate to the page for a primary source, they
are presented with a longer caption---anywhere between a few sentences
and a few paragraphs---placing the item in context with other documents
or relevant historical material. Research for the content of these
captions often involved cross-referencing the periodical record, oral
histories and secondary sources.

[^20]: Just as the multiplicity of Rainbow Sign's rooms and functions
invited cross-pollination---those there for lunch might take in an art
show; concert attendees might browse through a chapbook of poetry---the
diverse "rooms" of our site work to inspire dialogue between the art
objects, and between the performers. Our framing commentary exists to
enrich context, but seeks as well to set itself clearly in the space of
the frame. The formal affordances of the website, meanwhile, allow us to
offer a layered experience of exploration. Music once performed at
Rainbow Sign can play over the speakers while one browses; images of
rooms then and now can fill in the mental picture of a poetry reading
described in an article.
